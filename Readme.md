-This is a genreral representation of how a ransomware virus works. this is a version for unix based operatimg systems.
-This is upgraded version of my previous Basic Ransomware Project uploaded on my github profile. major drawback of old version was it only encrypred files directly in the targeted directory and not files inside subdirectories.
